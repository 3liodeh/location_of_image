Introduction:
This code represents a machine learning model that utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNN) to predict latitude and longitude coordinates based on images.
The purpose of this model is to demonstrate how to train a regression model using image data and visualize the training progress.
However, due to the time limitations of the free plan in Google Colab, the model's performance may not be optimized to its fullest potential.

Code Overview:

Image Data Acquisition:

The code reads image data from a specified directory using the OpenCV library (cv2.imread() function) and stores them in the images[] list.
Generating Random Latitude and Longitude:

Random latitude and longitude coordinates are generated for each image and stored in the latitude_longitude[] list. These coordinates serve as the target values for regression.
Saving Latitude and Longitude:

The latitude and longitude values are saved in a text file named "latitude_longitude.txt" for reference and analysis purposes.
Distance Calculation:

The code calculates the distances between a predefined reference location and each set of latitude and longitude coordinates using the geodesic() function from the geopy.distance module. These distances are not used for training but can provide additional insights.
Model Architecture:

The model architecture is defined using the Keras framework, specifically the Sequential model.
BatchNormalization, Conv2D, GaussianDropout, and Dense layers are used to extract features and predict latitude and longitude.
Model Compilation and Training:

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function, and mean absolute error (MAE) as the evaluation metric.
The fit() function is used to train the model, where the image data (images[]) is the input, and the corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates (latitude_longitude[]) are the target values. The training runs for 200 epochs with a validation split of 0.1 and a batch size of 8.
Training Visualization:

The code utilizes the matplotlib.pyplot library to generate and display plots for the validation loss, validation MAE, training loss, and training MAE, allowing for visual assessment of the model's performance during training.
Model Saving:

The trained model is saved to a file named "my_model.h5" using the save() function for future use or deployment.
